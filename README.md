# dynamic-website
This website was created by Nishant Kaushal. This website was particularly made so that website can stay dynamic on local computer without using domain. But for uploading it to a website, you have to make the following changes:

1) Rename the files index.php, blog.php,blog.php ,contact.php course.php, and about.php as.html files.
2) Make the same changes in the href of every html file.

And you are good to go.
