# dynamic-website
This website is created by Nishant kaushal. This website was particularly made so that website can stay dynamic in local computer without using domain. But for uploading it to website you have to make following changes :

1) Rename files index.php ,blog.php ,contact.php ,course.php,about.php as .html file.
2)Make same changes in href of every html file.

And you are good to go
